This project was made during a course in computer communications/ networks,
This was my first try in using signalR. The assignment was to create an ordersystem for a restaurant.
When the projekt is run, you can open one browser for the customer view, and one for the kitchen view.

When the customer adds an order, the kitchen view receives a notice of this, and can change the status
of the order to tell the customer view of the order progress.

#Techniques used:

.Net Core 2.0,
Javascript,
SignalR,
Bootstrap
